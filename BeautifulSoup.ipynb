among people at least 70 years old in England, the scientists wrote in a paper that was posted online on Monday but not yet published in a journal or vetted by other researchers.That figure appeared to rise in the following week, though there was a high level of statistical uncertainty in the subsequent number.For countries across Europe that have been hesitant about authorizing the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in older people, the data could resolve some of those doubts.', 'The early clinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine did not enroll as many older people as the trials of other shots, making a number of European countries uneasy about using it in that age group .But Britain decided to authorize the vaccine for people of all ages, creating a valuable store of data on its

far, researchers have tried to infer the effect of variants by looking at their prevalence in different populations and by doing laboratory studies.', ' Johnson vaccine is rated as highly effective at

first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine substantially reduced the risk of older people becoming ill with Covid-19, scientists in Britain reported on Monday, the strongest sign yet that a shot that much of the world is relying on to end the pandemic will protect the elderly.Four weeks after the first dose, the vaccine was roughly 60 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 among people at least 70 years old in England, the scientists wrote in a paper that was posted online on Monday but not yet published in a journal or vetted by other researchers.That figure appeared to rise in the following week, though there was a high level of statistical uncertainty in the subsequent number.For countries across Europe that have been hesitant about authorizing the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in older people, the data could resolve some of those doubts.', 'The early clinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine did not enroll as many older people as the trials of other shots, making a number of European countries uneasy about using it in that age group .But Britain decided to authorize the vaccine for people of all ages, creating a valuable store of data on its effectiveness.In France, one of the countries that had restricted the AstraZeneca vaccine to younger people, the country', 'Among people at least 70 years old, a first dose was 61 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 up to four weeks after the shot, a figure that then plateaued, the study said.', 'In people at least 80 years old, a first dose was 70 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 four weeks later, a figure that rose to 89 percent two weeks after the second shot.', ' Johnson vaccine, though, it may be possible to effectively choose what you get by choosing where you sign up to get it.Health experts say the best shot is the one you can get the soonest, whichever one it turns out to be.', 'Iceland is undertaking a similar effort, he said, and he expects Israel to do so, also.So far, researchers have tried to infer the effect of variants by looking at their prevalence in different populations and by doing laboratory studies.', ' Johnson vaccine is rated as highly effective at preventing serious illness and death, as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are.', 'It is also very effective at preventing milder illness, though a bit less so than those two.', ' Johnson vaccine appears to be less prone than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to trigger the kinds of side effects that require monitoring after the injection, which may make it more suitable for use at drive-through vaccination sites.', 'There have been reports that side effects tend to be felt more strongly after second doses, which the Johnson', 'Among people at least 70 years old, a first dose was 61 percent

strongest sign yet that a shot that much of the world is relying on to end the pandemic will protect the elderly.Four weeks after the first dose, the vaccine was roughly 60 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 among people at least 70 years old in England, the scientists wrote in a paper that was posted online on Monday but not yet published in a journal or vetted by other researchers.That figure appeared to rise in the following week, though there was a high level of statistical uncertainty in the subsequent number.For countries across Europe that have been hesitant about authorizing the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in older people, the data could resolve some of those doubts.', 'Images_1':
